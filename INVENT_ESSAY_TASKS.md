Task 1 — Evaluate Emotional Penetration: Look at the cat picture and determine how far beneath the surface of a quick, automatic reaction the image is able to reach. A picture that only provokes a shallow response — a laugh at something silly, a brief impulse to pet something fluffy — scores low. A picture that pushes past that outer layer and arrives at something unexpected, something that tightens in the chest or catches the viewer off guard with a feeling they did not anticipate, scores high. The task is to distinguish between images that merely touch the viewer and images that find their way to the tender, unguarded places where real feeling lives — the places associated with love, loss, fragility, and the quiet astonishment of being a creature in the world alongside other creatures. Ignore photographic technique, cuteness, and humor. Focus only on the depth of the emotional place the image is capable of reaching.

Task 2 — Evaluate Resonance with Universal Experience: Determine the degree to which the cat picture, despite being an image of a cat, manages to gesture toward something larger and more universally human. The most emotionally deep cat pictures are never really about cats — they are about what the cat, in that moment, in that light, in that posture, allows the viewer to recognize about their own life. A kitten bewildered by snow resonates because every person has stood at the edge of something unfamiliar. An elderly cat resting in fading afternoon light resonates because every person has felt the beauty and ache of things that are temporary. A cat grooming a frail companion resonates because every person has loved someone they could not protect. The task is to evaluate whether the image connects to the shared emotional landscape of human experience — tenderness, vulnerability, innocence, companionship, wonder, aging, solitude, trust — or whether it remains a charming but self-contained snapshot that points to nothing beyond itself. Images that borrow the vocabulary of a cat's life to say something true about all life score highest.

Task 3 — Evaluate Durability of Feeling: Assess the likelihood that a viewer will carry the feeling produced by the cat picture beyond the moment of looking at it. Many images provoke strong immediate reactions that evaporate almost instantly — a cat making a dramatic face is hilarious for two seconds and then gone, a cat in an absurd costume is delightful and then immediately disposable. These are firecrackers: bright, loud, and leaving nothing behind. The task is to identify images that work more like embers — they may not produce the loudest initial reaction, but what they produce continues to glow. Will this image resurface unbidden while the viewer is washing dishes, or driving, or lying in the dark waiting for sleep? Will it come back in a week when the viewer sees their own cat sleeping, or notices the quality of late-afternoon light, or feels a sudden pang of tenderness they cannot immediately explain? Images that become part of the viewer's emotional furniture — not because they are trying to be unforgettable, but because they have touched something true enough that the mind refuses to let them go — score highest.
