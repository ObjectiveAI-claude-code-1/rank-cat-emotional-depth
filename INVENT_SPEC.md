Rank the provided cat pictures by the depth of feeling each one provokes — the weight, staying power, and emotional penetration of the response beyond the initial moment of contact. An image with high depth does not just make the viewer react; it makes them stay, linger, return, and remember. It captures something that gestures toward larger human experiences — tenderness, vulnerability, innocence, companionship, aging, wonder — in a way that settles beneath the surface and resurfaces unbidden later. An elderly cat resting peacefully in fading light, a cat gently grooming a companion who is clearly unwell, a kitten encountering snow for the first time with its whole body a question mark of confusion and wonder — these images tap into something that outlasts the act of looking. Evaluate how deeply the image penetrates beneath the surface of a quick reaction and how likely the feeling is to endure. Not just whether the viewer reacts, but whether they remember. Images that provoke only fleeting surface reactions should rank lower. Images that carry emotional weight the viewer takes with them should rank highest. Technical quality, composition, and aesthetic polish are irrelevant — only the depth and durability of the feeling matters.
